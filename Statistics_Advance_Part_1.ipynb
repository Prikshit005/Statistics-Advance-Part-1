        "- In probability theory, a random variable is a way to assign numbers to the outcomes of a random experiment. It helps us describe uncertain events using mathematics. For example, if we flip a coin, we might define a random variable that assigns the number 1 to \"heads\" and 0 to \"tails.\" There are two types: discrete random variables, which take specific separate values (like whole numbers), and continuous random variables, which can take any value within a range (like measuring time or height). Random variables make it easier to calculate probabilities and analyze outcomes."

For example, the number of goals scored in a football match (like 0, 1, 2, etc.) is discrete. On the other hand, a continuous random variable can take any value within a range, including fractions and decimals. For instance, the height of students in a class or the time it takes to run a race are continuous because they can have many possible values. These types help us choose the right methods to work with different kinds of data in probability."

A discrete distribution is used for data that can take only specific, separate values, like the number of apples in a basket or the result of rolling a die. These values are countable. In contrast, a continuous distribution is used for data that can take any value within a range, like a person‚Äôs weight or the time it takes to finish a race. These values are not countable because there are infinitely many possibilities within any range. So, discrete deals with exact counts, while continuous deals with measurements."

It tells us the probability of each possible value the variable can take. For discrete random variables, this is called a probability mass function (PMF) and it gives the exact probability for each value. For continuous random variables, the PDF is a curve, and the probability of the variable falling within a certain range is found by calculating the area under the curve for that range. In simple terms, a PDF helps us understand how probabilities are spread across different values."

So, the CDF adds up the probabilities from the beginning up to that point. In short, the PDF shows individual probabilities, and the CDF shows the cumulative or total probability up to a given value."
